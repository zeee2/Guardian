#  Guardian

Protect discord server from Bot Spammer!

## Setup
I will not help install mysql, but just prepare run guardian bot.

First, install the requirements.
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once that's finished, you can go ahead and make a config file, by doing:
```
$ python3 run.py
$ nano config.json
```
Then you can go ahead and change the needed stuff in there. _MARKED WITH "CHANGE THIS"_

Once that's finished, you can go ahead and setup db tables, by doing:
```
$ python3 dbsetup.py
```

And the last thing you have to do, is running the Guardian Bot.
```
$ python3 run.py
```
If there's any issues during setup, feel free to post an issue.

- Experience developing in Python.
- Mysql Server (i use MariaDB)
